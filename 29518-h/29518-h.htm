<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>The German claim that as the result
of the Zeppelin raid "England's industry
to a considerable extent is in
ruins" is probably based on the fact
that three breweries were bombed. To
the Teuton mind such a catastrophe
might well seem overwhelming.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A possible explanation of the Government's
action in closing the Museums
is furnished by the <i>Cologne Gazette</i>,
which observes that "if one wanted
to find droves of Germans in London
one had only to go to the museums."
But if the Government is closing
them merely for purposes of disinfection
it might let us know.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Irritated by the pro-German conversation
of one of the guests at an
American dinner-party the English
butler poured the gravy over him.
The story is believed to have greatly
annoyed the starving millionaires in
Berlin. They complain that their exiled
fellow-countrymen get all the luck.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Is the Office of Works feeding Germany?
We have lately learned that
no bulbs are to be planted in the
London parks this season; and almost
simultaneously we read in the <i>Frankfurter
Zeitung</i> a suggestion that, as
bulbs are so cheap owing to the falling-off
in the English demand, they should
be used as food by the German housewife.
What has Mr. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> to
say about this?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ted Heaton</span>, a noted Liverpool
swimmer, is acting as sergeant-instructor
to the Royal Fusiliers at
Dover, and is expected to have them
in a short time quite ready for the
trenches.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A London magistrate has ruled that
poker is a game of chance. He was
evidently unacquainted with the leading
case in America, where, on the
same point arising, the judge, the
counsel and the parties adjourned for a
quiet game, and the defendant triumphantly
demonstrated that it was a
game of skill.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In an article describing the wonders
of modern French surgery Mrs. W.K.
<span class="smcap">Vanderbilt</span> mentioned that she had
watched an operation in which a part
of a man's rib was taken out and used
as a jawbone. "Pooh!" said the much-married
general practitioner who read
it, "that's as old as Adam."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A man who applied recently to be
enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps as
a carpenter was medically rejected because
he had a hammer toe. If he
had lost a nail we could have understood
it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following letter has been received
by the matron of an Indian hospital:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear and fair Madam</span>,-I have much
pleasure to inform you that my dearly unfortunate
wife will be no longer under your care,
she having left this world for the next on the
27th ult. For your help in this matter I
shall ever remain grateful.
Yours reverently, &mdash;&mdash;."</p></div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A correspondent, anxious about
etiquette, writes:&mdash;"Sir,&mdash;The other
day I offered my seat to the lady-conductor
of a tramcar. Did I right?&mdash;Yours
truly, <span class="smcap">Noblesse Oblige</span>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is stated that one of the principal
items of discussion during the new
Session of the Prussian Diet will be
a Supplementary War Bill. Some of
the members are expected to protest,
on the ground that the present War
is quite sufficient, thank you.<!-- Page 98 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="page98" id="page98">[pg 98]</a></span></p>

<h2>DIPLOMACY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tell</span> us," said Phyllis laboriously, "about diploma&mdash;&mdash;"
and there it stuck.</p>

<p>"Tistics," added Lillah in a superior manner.</p>

<p>Being an uncle, I can never give my brain a rest. It is
the easiest thing in the world to be found out by a child of
seven.</p>

<p>"You mean," I said, "diplomatists?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Phyllis in a monotone. "Daddy said they-weren't-any earthly-blast-them
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" I said hastily. I can imagine what George
said about diplomatists. He held a good deal of Balkan stock.</p>

<p>"Well, are they?" asked Lillah innocently.</p>

<p>"Diplomatists," I said, "are people in spats and creased
trousers, and the truth is not in them."</p>

<p>"What is spats?" asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>"Spats," I answered, "are what people wear when they
want to get a job and their boots are shabby."</p>

<p>"Are diplomatists shabby?" queried Lillah.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," I answered rather bitterly.</p>

<p>"Do they want jobs?"</p>

<p>"They want to keep them," I said.</p>

<p>"So they have spats," said Phyllis, completely satisfied.</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said. "Then they go into an extremely
grand room together and talk."</p>

<p>"What about?" said Lillah.</p>

<p>"Oh, anything that turns up," I answered&mdash;"the rise
in prices or the late thaw; or if everything fails they simply
make personal remarks."</p>

<p>"Like clergymen," said Phyllis vaguely.</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said. "And all round the building are
secret police disguised as reporters, and reporters disguised
as secret police. And then each of the diplomatists goes
away and writes a white paper, or a black paper, or a
greeny-yellow paper, to show that he was right."</p>

<p>"And then?" Phyllis gaped with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Then everybody organises, and centralises, and fraternises,
and defraternises, and, in the end, mobilises."</p>

<p>Phyllis and Lillah simply stared.</p>

<p>"Why?" they both gasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, just to show the diplomatists were wrong," I said
airily.</p>

<p>"And then?" said Lillah breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The ratepayers pay more."</p>

<p>"What is a ratepayer?" asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>"A notorious geek and gull," I said, borrowing from a
more distinguished writer.</p>

<p>Lillah stared at me with misgiving.</p>

<p>"But why don't the diplomists say what's true?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Because," I said, "they'd lose their money and nobody
would love them."</p>

<p>"But," said Phyllis, "Mummie said if we were good
everyone would love us."</p>

<p>"Your mother was quite right," I answered, with a
distinct twinge of that thin-ice feeling.</p>

<p>"Well, but you said nobody would love diplomists if
they were good," said Phyllis.</p>

<p>"So good people aren't loved," added Lillah, "and
Mummie said what wasn't true."</p>

<p>I fought desperately for a reply. This could not be
allowed to pass. It struck at the roots of nursery constitutionalism.</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, without any pretence at logic, "but the
poor diplomatists don't know any better."</p>

<p>"Like the heathen that Mummie tells us about on
Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Between the heathen and a diplomatist," I said, "there
is nothing to choose."</p>

<p>Phyllis sighed. "I wish I didn't know any better," she
said yearningly. Lillah looked at me dangerously from the
corner of her eye.</p>

<p>"And got money for it," she added.</p>

<p>"Would you like to play zoo?" I said hastily.</p>

<p>They were silent.</p>

<p>"I'll be a bear," I said eagerly&mdash;"a polar one."</p>

<p>No answer. I felt discouraged, but I made another effort.
"Or," I said, "I can be a monkey and you can throw nuts
at me, or" &mdash;desperately&mdash; "a ring-tailed lemur, or an orangoutang,
or an ant-eater...." My voice tailed away and
there was silence. Then the small voice of Phyllis broke in.</p>

<p>"Uncle," she said, "why aren't you a diplomist?"</p>

<p>At that point Nurse came in and I slid quietly off. As
I was going out of the door I heard the voice of Lillah.</p>

<p>"Nannie," she said, "tell us about diplomists."</p>

<p>"You leave diplomatists alone, Miss Lillah," said Nurse;
"they won't do you no harm if you don't talk about
them."</p>

<p>Now why couldn't I have thought of that? It's just
training, I suppose.</p>

<h2>JILLINGS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> always been very fond and proud of my niece
Celia. With an exceptionally attractive appearance and a
personal fascination that is irresistible she combines the
sweetest and most unselfish nature it has ever been my
good fortune to meet. Indeed, she has so excessive a consideration
for the feelings of everybody but herself that she
drifts into difficulties which she might have avoided by a
little more firmness. As, for example, in the case of
Jillings. Celia and Jack have been married six years; he
is about twelve years older than she, and a capital good
fellow, though he is said to have rather a violent temper.
But he has never shown it with Celia&mdash;nobody could,
had left the Army on his marriage
and settled down in a
pretty little place in Surrey, but
of course rejoined the Service
as soon as the War broke out.
So long as he was in training
with his regiment she took
rooms in the neighbourhood,
but when he was ordered to
the Front about a year ago she
and the children returned to the
Surrey home, and it was then
that Celia engaged Jillings as
parlourmaid. I saw her shortly
afterwards when I went down
to stay for a night, and was
struck by the exuberant enthusiasm
with which she waited&mdash;not
over efficiently&mdash;at table.
Celia remarked afterwards that
Jillings was a little inexperienced
as yet, but so willing and warm-hearted,
and with such a sensitively
affectionate disposition
that the least hint of reproof
sufficed to send her into a flood
of tears.</p>

<p>I had no idea then&mdash;nor had
Celia&mdash;how much inconvenience
and embarrassment can be
produced by a warm-hearted
parlour-maid. Jillings' devotion
did not express itself in a
concrete form until Celia's
birthday, and the form it took
was that of an obese and unimaginably hideous pincushion
which mysteriously appeared on her dressing-table.
Old and attached servants are in the habit of presenting
their employers on certain occasions with some appropriate
gift, and no one would be churlish enough to discourage so
kindly a practice. But Jillings, it must be owned, was
beginning it a bit early. However, Celia thanked her as
charmingly as though she had been longing all her life for
exactly such a treasure. Still, it was not only unnecessary
but distinctly unwise to add that it should be placed in her
wardrobe for safety, as being much too gorgeous for everyday
use. Because all she gained by this consummate tact
was another pincushion, not quite so ornate perhaps, but
even cruder in colour, and this she was compelled to assign a
prominent position among her toilet accessories.</p>

<p>These successes naturally encouraged Jillings to further
efforts. Celia had the misfortune one day to break a piece
of valuable old porcelain which had stood on her drawing-room
mantelpiece, whereupon the faithful Jillings promptly
replaced the loss by a china ornament purchased by herself.
Considered merely as an article of <i>vertu</i> it was about
on a par with the pincushions, but Celia accepted it in the
spirit with which it had been offered. And, warned by
experience, she did not lock it up in the obscurity of a
cabinet, nor contrive that some convenient accident should
befall it, wisely preferring "to bear those ills she had than
fly to others," etc. And so it still remains a permanent
eyesore on her mantelshelf.</p>

<p>Then it seemed that Jillings, who, by the way, was not
uncomely, had established friendly relations with one of
the gardeners at the big house of the neighbourhood&mdash;with
the result that Celia found her sitting-rooms replenished
at frequent intervals with the most magnificent specimens
of magnolia, tuberose, stephanotis and gardenia. Unfortunately
she happens to be one
of those persons whom any
strongly scented flowers afflict
with violent headache. But she
never mentioned this for fear of
wounding Jillings' susceptibilities.
Luckily, Jillings and the
under-gardener fell out in a
fortnight.</p>

<p>As was only to be expected,
the other servants, being equally
devoted to their mistress, could
not allow Jillings to monopolize
the pride and glory of putting
her under an obligation. Very
soon a sort of competition
sprang up, each of them endeavouring
to out-do the other
in giving Celia what they
termed, aptly enough, "little
surprises," till they hit upon
the happy solution of clubbing
together for the purpose. Thus
Celia, having, out of the kindness
of her heart, ordered an
expensive lace hood for the
baby from a relation of the
nurse's at Honiton, was dismayed
to discover, when the
hood arrived, that it was
already paid for and was a joint
gift from the domestics. After
that she felt, being Celia, that
it would be too ungracious to
insist on refunding the money.</p>

<p>It was not until I was staying with her last Spring that
I heard of all these excesses. But at breakfast on Easter
Sunday not only did Celia, Tony and the baby each receive
an enormous satin egg filled with chocolates, but I was
myself the recipient of one of these seasonable tokens, being
informed by the beaming Jillings that "we didn't want <i>you</i>,
Sir, to feel you'd been forgotten." By lunch-time it
became clear that she had succeeded in animating at least
one of the local tradesmen with this spirit of reckless liberality.
For when Celia made a mild inquiry concerning a
sweetbread which she had no recollection of having ordered
Jillings explained, with what I fear I must describe as a
self-conscious smirk, that it was "a little Easter orfering
from the butcher, Madam." I am bound to say that even
Celia was less scrupulous about hurting the butcher's feelings&mdash;no
doubt from an impression that his occupation
must have cured him of any over-sensitiveness.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone she told me all she had been
enduring, which it seemed she had been careful not to
mention in her letters to Jack. "I simply can't tell you,<!-- Page 101 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="page101" id="page101">[pg 101]</a></span>
Uncle," she concluded pathetically, "how wearing it is to
be constantly thanking somebody for something I'd ever
so much rather be without. And yet&mdash;what else can I do?"</p>

<p>I suggested that she might strictly forbid all future
indulgence in these orgies of generosity, and she supposed
meekly that she should really have to do something of that
sort, though we both knew how extremely improbable it
was that she ever would.</p>

<p>This morning I had a letter from her. Jack had got
leave at last and she was expecting him home that very
afternoon, so I must come down and see him before his six
days expired. "I wish now," she went on, "that I had
taken your advice, but it was so difficult somehow. Because
ever since I told Jillings and the others about Jack's
coming home they have been going about smiling so
importantly that I'm horribly afraid they're planning
some dreadful surprise, and I daren't ask them what.
Now I must break off, as I must get ready to go to the
station with Tony and meet dear Jack...."</p>

<p>Then followed a frantic postscript. "I know <i>now</i>!
They've dressed poor Tony up in a little khaki uniform
that doesn't even fit him! And, what's worse, they've
put up a perfectly terrible triumphal arch over the front
gate, with 'Hail to our Hero' on it in immense letters.
They all seem so pleased with themselves&mdash;and anyway
there's no time to alter anything now. But I don't know
what Jack will say."</p>

<p>I don't either, but I could give a pretty good guess. I
shall see him and Celia to-morrow. But I shall be rather
surprised if I see Jillings.</p>

the President at close quarters outside
and inside the White House and what
happened at the historic dinner-party,
at which I was the only representative
of a belligerent country present.</p>

<p>By a fortunate coincidence Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> arrived at the railway dep&ocirc;t
on his return from a game of golf
with his secretary, Mr. <span class="smcap">Tumulty</span>, as I
was loitering at the bookstall. I had
never seen either of them before, but
intuitively recognised them in a flash.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tumulty</span> looked exactly as a man
with so momentous a name could only
look. <span class="smcap">The President</span> was garbed in a
neutral-tinted lounge-suit and wore a
dark fawn overcoat and dove-coloured
spats.</p>

<p>How did the <span class="smcap">President</span> look? Well,
his face was obviously the face of a
changed man. Not that he is changed
for the worse. He seemed in the pink
of condition, and his clean-cut profile
and firm jaw radiated inflexible determination
at every pore. No signs of
a moustache are yet visible on his
finely-chiselled upper lip.</p>

<p>I had no introduction, and no time
was to be lost, so without a moment's
hesitation I strode up to the <span class="smcap">President</span>
and said, "Permit me, Sir, as the
accredited representative of a neutral
nation, to offer you this token of respect,"
and handed him a small Dutch
cheese, a dainty to which I had been
informed he was especially partial. The
<span class="smcap">President</span> smiled graciously, handed
the offering to his secretary, and said,
"I thank you, Sir. Won't you join
us at the White House at dinner to-night?"
I expressed my acceptance
in suitable terms, bowed and passed on.</p>

<p>The dinner took place in the famous
octagonal dining-room of the White
House, which was profusely decorated
with the flags of the Scandinavian
Kingdoms, Spain, Greece, China, Chile,
Peru, Brazil and the Argentine.</p>

<p>The band of the Washington Post
Office Rifles was ensconced behind a
trellis of olive branches and discoursed
a choice selection of soothing music.
Flagons of grape-juice and various light
and phosphorescent beverages stood
on the sideboard. It was a memorable
scene and every detail was indelibly
impressed on my mind. The <span class="smcap">President</span>
greeted his guests with the calm dignity
proper to his high office. He
does not affect the high handshake of
English smart society, but a firm yet
gentle clasp. In repose his features
reminded me of <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span>, but
when he smiles he recalls the more
genial lineaments of the great <span class="smcap">Pompey</span>.
The general impression created on
my mind was one of refined simplicity.
As the <span class="smcap">President</span> himself remarked,
quoting <span class="smcap">Thucydides</span> to one of his
Greek guests, [Greek: philukalonmen meht ehuteleias].</p>

<p>It is quite untrue that the conversation
was confined to the English tongue.
On the contrary all the neutral languages,
except Chinese, were spoken,
the <span class="smcap">President</span> showing an equal facility
in every one, and honourably making a
point of never uttering two consecutive
sentences in the same tongue. War
topics were rigorously eschewed, and so
far as I could follow the conversation&mdash;I
only speak five of the neutral languages&mdash;the
subjects ranged from golf
to hygienic clothing, from co-education
to coon-can.</p>

<p>I do not propose here and now to
state the circumstances in which, on
leaving the White House, I was kidnapped
by some emissaries of Count
<span class="smcap">Bernstorff</span>, and ultimately consigned
to the Tombs in New York on a false
charge of manslaughter; how I narrowly
escaped being electrocuted, and
was subsequently deported to Bermuda
as an undesirable alien. What I saw
and endured in the Tombs is another
story. What really matters is the Bill
of Fare of the <span class="smcap">President</span>'s dinner,
which was printed in Esperanto and
ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Turtle Dove Soup.<br/>
Norwegian Salmon Cutlets.<br/>
Iceland Reindeer Steak.<br/>
Tipperusalein Artichokes and Spanish Onions.<br/>
Chaudfroid &agrave; la Woodrow.<br/>
Irene Pudding.<br/>
Dutch Cheese Straws.<br/>
Brazil Nuts.</p>

<p>After dinner Greek cigarettes were
handed round with small cups of China
tea and, as an alternative, Peruvian
<i>mat&eacute;.</i></p>

<h2>THE INVASION.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I thought</span>&mdash;being very old indeed,
"older," as a poem by Mr. <span class="smcap">Sturge
Moore</span> begins, "than most sheep"&mdash;I
thought, being so exceedingly mature
and disillusioned, that I knew all the
worries of life. Yet I did not; there
was still one that was waiting for me
round the corner, but I know that
too, now.</p>

<p>I will tell you about it.</p>

<p>To begin with, let me describe myself.
I am an ordinary quiet-living obscure
person, neither exalted nor lowly, who,
having tired of town, took a little
place in the country and there settled
down to a life of placidity, varied by
such inroads upon ease as all back-to-the-landers
know: now a raid on the
chickens by a fox, whose humour it is
not to devour but merely to decapitate;
now the disappearance of the gardener
at Lord <span class="smcap">Derby's</span> coat-tails; now a
flood; and now and continually a desire
on the part of the cook to give a month's
notice, if you please, and the consequent
resumption of correspondence
with the registry office. There you
have the main lines of the existence
not only of myself, but of thousands
of other English rural recluses. But
for such little difficulties I have been
happy&mdash;a Cincinnatus ungrumbling.</p>

<p>The new fly entered the ointment
about three weeks ago, when a parcel
was brought to me by a footman from
the Priory, some three miles away, with
a message to the effect that it had been
delivered there and opened in error.
They were of course very sorry.</p>

<p>I asked how the mistake had
occurred.</p>

<p>"Same name," he said. "The house
has just been let furnished to some
people of the same name as yourself."</p>

<p>Now I have always rather prided
myself on the rarity of my name. I
don't go so far as to claim that it came
over with the <span class="smcap">Conqueror</span>, but it is an
old name and an uncommon one, and
hitherto I had been the only owner of
it in the district. To have it duplicated
was annoying.</p>

<p>Worse however was to come.</p>

<p>I do not expect to be believed, but
it is a solemn fact that within a fortnight
two more bearers of my name
moved into the village. One was a
cowman, and the other a maiden lady,
so that at the present moment there
are four of us all opening or rejecting
each other's letters. The thing is
absurd. One might as well be named
Smith right away.</p>

<p>I don't mind the cowman, but the
maiden lady is a large order. I have,
as I say, lived in this place for some
time&mdash;at least six years&mdash;and she
moved into The Laurels only ten days
ago, but when she came round this
morning with an opened telegram that
was not meant for her, she had the
maiden&mdash;ladylikehood to remark how
awkward it was when other people
had the same name as herself. "There
should," she said, "never be more than
one holder of a name in a small place."</p>

<p>I had no retort beyond the obvious
one that I got there first; but I hope
that the cowman henceforth gets all
her correspondence and delays it. He
is welcome to mine so long as he deals
faithfully with hers.</p>

<h2>NEWS FROM KIEL.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By our Naval Expert.</i>)</p>

<p>An interesting little item of news in
the daily papers of last Wednesday
may have escaped notice. It appears
that the German Liners which have
been laid up in New York harbour for
the last eighteen months have discovered
that their magnetic deviation
has been affected. This is the explanation
of the recent movement in the
harbour, when all the German ships
were turned round so as to readjust
their compasses.</p>

<p>The special significance of this information
is to be found by taking it in
conjunction with the recent puzzling
reports of movements of the German
High Seas Fleet. It will be remembered
that the Fleet was represented in
an enemy official report (with the customary
exaggeration) as sweeping out
into the North Sea. That was not
readily believed, but it was generally
felt that there must be something in it,
especially as all manner of rumours of
naval activity kept coming through
from Scandinavia about the same time.</p>

<p>Our naval experts in this country were
quite at a loss, but to-day the riddle
is solved. What was happening was
that the High Seas Fleet was <i>turning
round</i>.</p>

<p>I have had the good fortune to fall
in with a neutral traveller&mdash;of the usual
high standing and impartial sympathies&mdash;who
has supplied a few details. It
seems that great excitement prevailed
at this scene of unwonted bustle and
activity. The operation was carried
out under favourable weather conditions
practically without a hitch, the
casualties being quite negligible, and
the <i>moral</i> of the men, in spite of their
long period of enforced coma, being
absolutely unshaken. One and all have
now cheerfully accepted the disconcerting
changes involved in the new
orientation, and window-boxes have
been generally shifted to the sunny
side.</p>

<p>Still, the sacrifice was well meant.</p>

<h2>AT THE FRONT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one matter I have hitherto
not touched on, because it has not hitherto
touched on me, and that is Courses.</p>

<p>The ideal course works like this.
You are sitting up to the ears in mud
under a brisk howitzer, trench mortar
and rifle grenade fire, when a respectful
signaller crawls round a traverse,
remarking, "Message, Sir."</p>

<p>You take the chit from him languidly,
wondering whether you have earned a
court-martial by omitting to report on
the trench sleeping-suits which someone
in the Rearward Services has
omitted to forward, and you read, still
languidly at first; then you get up and
whoop, throw your primus stove into
the air and proceed to dance on the
parapet, if your trench has one. Then
you settle down and read your message
again to see if it still runs, "You are
detailed to attend three months' Staff
work course at Boulogne, commencing
to-morrow. A car will be at the dump
for you to-night. A month's leave on
completion, of course."</p>

<p>But all courses are not like this; all
you can say is that some are less unlike
it than others. I was sitting in a warm
billet about twelve noon having breakfast
on the first day out of trenches
when the blow fell on me. I was to
report about two days ago at a School
of Instruction some two hundred yards
away. I gathered that the course
had started without me. I set some
leisurely inquiries in train, in the hope
that it might be over before I joined
up. I also asked the Adjutant whether
I couldn't have it put off till next time
in trenches, or have it debited to me
as half a machine-gun course payable
on demand, or exchange it for a guinea-pig
or a canary, or do anything consistent
with the honour of an officer to
stave it off. For to tell the truth, like
all people who know nothing and have
known it for a long time, I cherish a
deeply-rooted objection to being instructed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Adjutant is one of
those weak fellows who always tell you
that they are mere machines in the
grip of the powers that change great
nations. So on the third day I bought
a nice new slate and satchel and
joined up.</p>

<p>Even now, after some days of intense
instruction, I find my condition is a
little confused and foggy. Of course
it covers practically the whole field of
military interests, and I ought to be
able to win the War in about three-quarters
of an hour, given a reasonable
modicum of men, guns, indents,
physical training and bayonet exercise,
knowledge of military law, and acquaintance
with the approved methods
of conducting a casualty clearing station,
a mechanical transport column, and a
field kitchen. The confusion of mind
evident in this last sentence is a high
testimonial to the comprehensive nature
of our course.</p>

<p>Physical training made the strongest
appeal to me. I remember some of
the best words, not perhaps as they
are, but as I caught them from an
almost over-glib expert. Did you know
you had a strabismal vertebra? or,
given a strabismal vertebra, that it
could be developed to almost any
extent by simply 'eaving from the 'ips?
Take my tip and try it next time you're
under shell-fire.</p>

<p>To-morrow we break up, and I join
the army. The army has gone away
somewhere while I wasn't looking, and
I shall have to make inquiries about
it. You never can tell what these
things will do when not kept under
the strictest observation. My bit <i>may</i>
have gone to Egypt or Nyassaland or
Nagri Sembilan. But I have a depressing
feeling that A 27 <i>x y z</i> iv. 9.8
will be nearer the mark, and that I
shall find it meandering nightly to
Bk 171 in large droves, there to insert
more and more humps of soggy Belgium
into more and more sandbags. I
don't want to make myself unpleasant
to the War Office, but I really can't see
why we haven't once and for all built
trenches all done up in eight-inch
thick steel plates. They could easily
be brought up ready-made, and simply
sunk into position.</p>

<p>They would sink all right; you'd
just have to put them down anywhere
and look the other way for a minute.
The difficulty would be to stop the lift
before it got to the basement&mdash;if there
is a basement in Flanders.</p>

<p>There is a tragedy to report. We
were adopted recently by a magpie.
He was a gentle creature of impulsive
habits and strong woodpecking instincts.
Ars&egrave;ne we called him. For
some days he gladdened us with his
soft bright eye. But when we came to
know him well and I relied on him to
break the shells of my eggs every
morning at breakfast, to steal my pens
and spill my ink, to wake me by a
gentle nip on the nose from his firm
but courteous beak, a rough grenadier
came one day to explain a new type of
infernal machine, and, when we went
out, left a detonator on the table.</p>

<p>I never saw what actually followed,
but we buried Ars&egrave;ne with full military
honours.</p>

<h2>A DUEL OF ENDURANCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> butcher's name is Bones. Yes,
I know it sounds too good to be true.
But I can't help it. Once more, his
name is Bones.</p>

<p>There is something wrong with
Bones. Mark him as he stands there
among all those bodies of sheep and
oxen, feeling with his thumb the edge
of that long sharp knife and gazing
wistfully across the way to where the
greengrocer's baby lies asleep in its
perambulator on the pavement. Observe
him start with a sigh from his
reverie as you enter his shop. What
is the matter with him? Why should
a butcher sigh?</p>

<p>I will tell you. He has been thinking
about the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> who is
breaking his heart through the medium
of the greengrocer's baby.</p>

<p>As all the world knows, between the
ages of one and two the best British
babies are built up on beef tea and
mutton broth; at two or thereabouts
they start on small chops. No one can
say when the custom arose. Like so
many of those unwritten laws on
which the greatness of England is
really based it has outgrown the
memory of its origin. But its force
is as universally binding to-day as it
was in Plantagenet times. Thus,
though numerous households since the
War began have temporarily adopted a
vegetarian diet, in the majority of
cases a line has been drawn at the
baby. That is why butchers at present
look on babies as their sheet-anchors.
It is through them that they
keep the toe of their boot inside the
family door. The little things they
send for them serve as a memento of
the old Sunday sirloin, a reminder that
while nuts may nourish niggers the
Briton's true prerogative is beef.</p>

<p>The greengrocer has given up meat.
But he has done more than this. He
has done what not even a greengrocer
should do. He has broken the tradition
of the ages. He is feeding his
baby on bananas.</p>

<p>At first the greengrocer's baby did
not like bananas and its cries were
awful. But after a while it got used
to them, and now even when it goes to
bed it clutches one in its tiny hand.
It is not so rosy as it was, but the
greengrocer says red-faced babies are
apoplectic and that the reason it
twitches so much in its sleep is because
it is so full of vitality. He is
advising all his customers to feed their
babies on bananas. Bones does not
care much what happens to the greengrocer's
baby, but he says if it lasts
much longer he will have to put his
shutters up. He is growing very despondent,
and I noticed the other day
that he had given up chewing suet&mdash;a
bad sign in a butcher.</p>

<p>It is a duel of endurance between
Bones and the greengrocer's baby. I
wonder which will win.</p>

<h2>TONNAGE.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, dear," said Francesca, "everything keeps going
up." She was engaged upon the weekly books and spoke
in a tone of heartfelt despair.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "you've known all along how it would
be. Everybody's told you so."</p>

<p>"Everybody? Who's everybody in this case?"</p>

<p>"I told you so for one, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> mentioned it
several times, and so did Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenna</span>."</p>

<p>"I have never," she said proudly, "discussed my weekly
books with Messrs. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> and <span class="smcap">McKenna</span>. I should
scorn the action."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," I said. "Keep them away as
far as you can, but they'll still get hold of you. The
<span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> knows your weekly books
by heart."</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, "he'd add them up for me. He's a
good adder-up, I suppose, or he wouldn't be what he is."</p>

<p>"He's fair to middling, I fancy&mdash;something like me."</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" she said, in a tone of ineffable contempt.
"You're no good at addition."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "you wrong me. I'm a great deal
of good. Of course I don't pretend to be able to run three
fingers up three columns of figures a yard long and to write
down the result as &pound;7,956 17<i>s.</i> 8<i>d</i>., or whatever it may be,
without a moment's pause. I can't do that, but for the
ordinary rough-and-tumble work of domestic addition I'm
hard to beat. Only if I'm to do these books of yours there
must be perfect silence in the room. I mustn't be talked to
while I'm wrestling with the nineteens and the seventeens
in the shilling column."</p>

<p>"In fact," said Francesca, "you ought to be a deaf adder."</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said, "how could you? Give me the
butcher's book and let there be no more <i>jeux de mots</i>
between us."</p>

<p>I took the book, which was a masterpiece of illegibility,
and added it up with my usual grace and felicity.</p>

<p>"Francesca," I said as I finished my task, "my total
differs from the butcher's, but the difference is in his favour,
not in mine. He seems to have imparted variety to his
calculations by considering that it took twenty pence to
make a shilling, which is a generous error. Now let me
deal with the baker while you tackle the grocer, and then
we'll wind up by doing the washing-book together."</p>

<p>The washing-book was a teaser, the items being
apparently entered in Chaldee, but we stumbled through
it at last.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "we can take up the subject of thrift."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about it," she said, "I'm thoroughly
tired of it. We've talked too much about it already."</p>

<p>"You're wrong there; we haven't talked half enough.
If we had, the books wouldn't have gone up."</p>

<p>"They haven't gone up," she said. "They're about
the same, but we've been having less."</p>

<p>"Noble creature," I said, "do you mean to say that
you've docked me of one of my Sunday sausages and the
whole of my Thursday roly-poly pudding and never said
a word about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't seem to notice it, so I left it alone."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I did notice it," I said, "but I determined to
suffer in silence in order to set an example to the children."</p>

<p>"That was bravely done," she said. "It encourages me
to cut down the Saturday sirloin."<!-- Page 109 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="page109" id="page109">[pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what will the servants say? They won't like it."</p>

<p>"They'll have to lump it then."</p>

<p>"But I thought servants never lumped it. I thought
they always insisted on their elevenses and all their other
food privileges."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," she said, "I'm going to make a push for
economy and the servants must push with me. They won't
starve, whatever happens."</p>

<p>"No, and if they begin to object you can talk to them
about tonnage."</p>

<p>"That ought to bowl them over. But hadn't I better
know what it means before I mention it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that might be an advantage."</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "Mrs. Mincer devotes to the reading
of newspapers all the time she can spare from the cooking
of meals and she'd be sure to trip me up if I ventured to
say anything about tonnage."</p>

<p>"Learn then," I said, "that tonnage means the amount
of space reserved for cargoes on ships&mdash;at least I suppose
that's what it means, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't seem very sure about it. Hadn't you better
look it up?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "That's good enough for Mrs. Mincer.
Now if there's an insufficiency of tonnage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why should there be an insufficiency of tonnage?"</p>

<p>"Because," I said, "the Government have taken up so
much tonnage for the purposes of the War. How did you
think the Army got supplied with food and shells and guns
and men? Did you think they flew over to France and
Egypt and Salonica?"</p>

<p>"Don't be rude," she said. "I didn't introduce this
question of tonnage. You did. And even now I don't see
what tonnage has got to do with our sirloin of beef."</p>

<p>"I will," I said kindly, "explain it to you all over again.
We have ample tonnage for necessaries, but not for
luxuries."</p>

<p>"But my sirloin of beef isn't a luxury."</p>

<p>"For the purpose of my argument," I said, "it is a
luxury and must be treated as such."</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "I don't think I'll bother
about tonnage. I'll tackle Mrs. Mincer in my own way."</p>

<p>"You're throwing away a great opportunity," I said.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "If I feel I'm being beaten
I'll call you in. Your power of lucid explanation will pull
me through."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">"Mrs. Pretty and the Premier."</span></p>

<h3>FIRST LOVE; OR THE JEUNE
PREMIER.</h3>

<p>Bill the Premier Mr. Arthur Bourchier.
<br/>
Mrs. Pretty Miss Kyrle Bellew.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> not sure that I didn't find Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bourchier's</span> "Foreword" or Apologia
(kindly given away with the programme)
rather more entertaining than the play
itself. As long as the dramatist (a New
Zealander) concerned himself with the
delightfully unconventional atmosphere
of Antipodean politics he was illuminating
and very possibly veracious.
But the relations between the <i>Premier</i>
and the widow <i>Pretty</i>, which promised,
as the title hinted, to be the main attraction,
were such as never could have
occurred on land or sea. It was impossible,
with this farcical element always
obtruding itself, to take the political
features of the play seriously, as I
gather that we were intended to do;
and we got very little help from Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bourchier's</span> own performance, which
was frankly humorous. In his brochure
he tells us with great solemnity that he
is "more than pleased to think that
the play may help to demonstrate to
those of an older civilisation how truly
the best of the so-called Labour politicians
strive to serve their country and
their fellow men.... Premier 'Bill'
demonstrates vividly enough that, heart
and soul, the Australian politician devotes
himself to the uplifting of the
great Commonwealth." Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier's</span>
tongue may or may not have
been in his cheek when he penned
these lofty sentiments, but anyhow it
seemed to be there during most of the
play.</p>

<p>He is on safer ground when he tells
us that "in curiously vivid and pungent
fashion this little play outlines
the breezy freshness and the originality
of outlook which almost invariably
characterise the politicians and statesmen
of the Prairie, the Veldt and the
Bush, and which more than anything
else perhaps differentiates them from
the men of an older land, hampered
as these latter often are by long and
stately traditions." Certainly, in the
matter of addressing its Premier by
a familiar abbreviation of his Christian
name (an authority who has travelled
in these parts assures Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span>
that he is "quite right:" that "people
would call this Premier 'Bill' in
Australia") the new world differs from
the old. I cannot so much as contemplate
the thought of Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span>
being addressed by the <span class="smcap">Minister Of
Munitions</span> as "Herb," or even "Bert."</p>

<p>But we have difficulties again with
the Foreword (for I cannot get away
from it) when we come to the question
of the hero's virility. In the play his
secretary says of him, "Bill's not a
man, he's a Premier. A kind of
dynamo running the country at top
speed." Yet the Foreword, after citing
this passage, goes on to insist upon his
"tingling humanity" and hinting at
the need of such a type of manhood at
the present time. "After all," concludes
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span> in a spasm of uplift&mdash;"after
all, what is the cry of the
moment here in the heart of the
Empire, but for <span class="smcap">'a Man</span>-Give us a
Man!'" But even if we reject the
secretary's estimate of his chief as a
dynamo we still find a certain deficiency
of manhood in the an&aelig;mic
indifference of the <i>Premier's</i> attitude
to women; an attitude, by the way,
not commonly associated with Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bourchier's</span> impersonations on the
stage. <i>Mrs. Pretty's</i> tastes are, of course,
her own affair, and we were allowed
little insight into her heart (if any), but
I can only conclude that her choice
was governed by political rather than
emotional considerations ("Let us remember
<span class="smcap">Women Have the Vote In
Australia</span>" is the finale of the Foreword)
and that what she wanted was a
Premier rather than a Man.</p>

<p>Of the play itself one may at least
say that it kept fairly off the beaten
track. There was novelty in its local
colour, its unfamiliar types and the
episode, adroitly managed, of a pair
of gloves employed to muffle the
division bell at the moment of a crisis
on which the fate of the Government
depended. But the design was too
small to fill the stage of His Majesty's
and it left me a little disappointed. I
was content so long as Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span>
was in sight, but the part of <i>Mrs.
Pretty</i> needed something more than
the rather conscious graces and airy
drapery of Miss <span class="smcap">Kyrle Bellew</span>. The
rest of the performance was sound but
not very exhilarating; and altogether,
though I hope I am properly grateful
for any help towards the realisation
of "Colonial conditions," I cannot
honestly say that <i>Mrs. Pretty</i> and the
<i>Premier</i> has done very much for me
(as Mr. <span class="smcap">Bourchier</span> hoped it would) by
way of supplementing the thrill of
Anzac. O.S.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> latest of our writers to contribute to the growing
literature of the War is Mr. <span class="smcap">Hugh Walpole</span>. He has
written a book about it called <i>The Dark Forest</i> (<span class="smcap">Secker</span>),
but whether it is a good or a bad book I who have read
it carefully from cover to cover confess my inability to
decide. It is certainly a clever book, and violently unusual.
I doubt whether the War is likely to produce anything else
in the least resembling it. For one thing, it deals with a
phase of the struggle, the Russian retreat through Galicia,
about which we in England are still tragically ignorant.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Walpole</span> writes of this as he himself has seen it in his
own experience as a worker with the Russian Red Cross.
The horrors, the compensations, the tragedy and happiness
of such work have come straight into the book from life.
But not content with this, he has peopled his mission with
fictitious characters and made a story about them. And
good as the story is, full of fine imagination and character,
the background is so tremendously more real that I was
constantly having to resist a feeling of impatience with the
false creations (in <i>Macbeth's</i> sense) who play out their unsubstantial
drama before it. Yet I am far from denying
the beauty of Mr. <span class="smcap">Walpole's</span> idea. The characters of
<i>Trenchard</i>, the self-doubting young Englishman, who finds
reality in his love for the nurse <i>Marie Ivanovna</i>, and of
the Russian doctor, <i>Semyonov</i>, who takes her from him,
are exquisitely realized. And the atmosphere of increasing
mental strain, in which, after <i>Marie's</i> death, the tragedy of
these three moves to its climax in the forest is the work of
an artist in emotion, such as by this time we know Mr.
<span class="smcap">Walpole</span> to be. The trouble was that I had at the
moment no wish for artistry. To sum up, I am left with
the impression that an uncommonly good short story rather
tiresomely distracted my attention from some magnificent
war-pictures.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As Field-Marshal Sir <span class="smcap">Evelyn Wood</span>, V.C., in <i>Our Fighting
Services</i> (<span class="smcap">Cassell</span>), begins with the Battle of Hastings and
ends with the Boer War there is no gainsaying the fact
that his net has been widely spread. To assist him in the
compilation of this immense tome the author has a fluent
style and&mdash;to judge from the authorities consulted and
the results of these consultations&mdash;an inexhaustible industry.
The one should make his book acceptable to the
amateur who reads history because he happens to love it,
and the other should make it invaluable to professionals
who handle books of reference, not lovingly, but of necessity.
And having said so much in praise of Sir <span class="smcap">Evelyn</span> I am
also happy to add that he is, on the whole, that rare thing&mdash;an
historian without prejudices. Almost desperately, for
instance, he tries to express his admiration of <span class="smcap">Oliver
Cromwell</span> as a soldier, although he quite obviously detests
him as a man. I find myself, however, wondering whether
Sir <span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>, were he writing of <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> at this hour,
would say, "For a man over forty years of age to work
hard to acquire the rudiments of drill is in itself remark<!-- Page 112 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="page112" id="page112">[pg 112]</a></span>able."
Even when allowance is made for the differences
between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries there
would seem to be nothing very worthy of remark in such
energy if one may judge from the attitude of our War
Office to the Volunteers. Naturally one turns eagerly to
see what this distinguished soldier has to say about
campaigns in which he took a personal part, but, although
shrewd criticism is not lacking, Sir <span class="smcap">Evelyn's</span> sword has
been more destructive than his pen. In these days of
tremendous events this volume may possibly be slow to
come to its own, but in due course it is bound to arrive.</p>

</div>

<p>I find, on referring to the "By the same Author" page of
<i>The Lad With Wings</i> (<span class="smcap">Hutchinson</span>), that other reviewers of
"<span class="smcap">Berta Buck's</span>" novels have been struck by the "charm"
of her work. I should like to be original, but I cannot
think of any better way of summing up the quality of her
writing. Charm above everything
else is what <i>The Lad
With Wings</i> possesses. It is a
perfectly delightful book, moving
at racing speed from the
first chapter to the last, and so
skilfully written that even the
technically unhappy ending
brings no gloom. When <i>Gwenna
Williams</i> and <i>Paul Dampier</i>,
the young airman she has married
only a few hours before the
breaking out of war, go down to
death together in mid-Channel
after the battle with the German
Taube, the reader feels with
<i>Leslie Long, Gwenna's</i> friend,
"The best time to go out! No
growing old and growing dull....
No growing out of love with
each other, ever! They at least
have had something that nothing
can spoil." I suppose that
when Mrs. <span class="smcap">Oliver Onions</span> is
interviewed as to her literary
methods it will turn out that
she re-writes everything a
dozen times and considers
fifteen hundred words a good
day's work; but she manages
in <i>The Lad With Wings</i> to
convey an impression of having written the whole story
at a sitting. The pace never flags for a moment, and
the characters are drawn with that apparently effortless
skill which generally involves anguish and the burning
of the midnight oil. I think I enjoyed the art of the
writing almost as much as the story itself. If you want
to see how a sense of touch can make all the difference,
you should study carefully the character of <i>Leslie</i>, a
genuine creation. But the book would be worth reading if
only for the pleasure of meeting <i>Hugo Swayne</i>, the intellectual
<i>dilettante</i> who, when he tried to enlist, was rejected
as not sufficiently intelligent and then set to painting
omnibuses in the Futurist mode, to render them invisible
at a distance. A few weeks from now I shall take down
<i>The Lad With Wings</i> from its shelf and read it all over
again. It is that sort of book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When old <i>Lady Polwhele</i> asked the <i>Reverend Dr. Gwyn</i>
to let his daughter <i>Delia</i> go with her as companion to a
very smart house party, I doubt whether the excellent man
would have given so ready an assent had he known what
was going to come of it. For my own part I suspected we
were in for yet another version of <i>Cinderella</i>, with <i>Delia</i>
snubbed by the smart guests, and eventually united, as
like as not, to young <i>Lord Polwhele</i>. However, Miss
<span class="smcap">Dorothea Townshend</span>, who has written about all these
people in <i>A Lion, A Mouse and a Motor Car</i> (<span class="smcap">Simpkin</span>),
had other and higher views for her heroine. True, the
house party was ultra-smart; true also that there was one
woman who spoke and behaved cattishly; but it was a
refreshing novelty to find that throughout the tale the ugly
sisters, so to speak, were hopelessly outnumbered by the
fairy godmothers. Later, the visit led to <i>Delia's</i> going as
governess to the children of a Russian Princess, and finding
herself in circles that might be described as not only
fast but furious. Here we were in a fine atmosphere of
intrigue, with spies, and Grand Dukes, and explosive golf
balls and I don't know what beside. It is all capital
fun; and, though I am afraid
the political plots left me unconvinced,
the thing is told with
such ease and <i>bonhomie</i> that it
is saved from banality; even
when the amazing cat of the
house-party turns up as a female
bandit and tries to hold <i>Delia</i>
and her Princess to ransom.
And of course the fact that the
period of the tale is that of the
earliest motors gives it the
quaintest air of antiquity.
Somehow, talk of sedan chairs
would sound more modern than
these thrills of excitement about
six cylinders and "smelly
petrol." In short, for many
reasons Miss <span class="smcap">Townshend's</span> book
provides a far brisker entertainment
than its cumbrous
title would indicate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stephen Graham</span> is fast
becoming the arch-interpreter
of Holy Russia. In <i>The Way
of Martha and the Way of
Mary</i> (<span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>) he returns
with even more than his customary
zeal to his good work,
wishing herein specifically to
interpret Russian Christianity to the West. A passionate
earnestness informs his discursive eloquence. I
cannot resist the conviction that he has the type of mind
that sees most easily what it wishes to see. He moves
cheerily along, incidentally raising difficulties which he
does not solve, ignoring conclusions which seem obvious,
throwing glorious generalisations and unharmonised contradictions
at the bewildered reader, too bent on his generous
purpose to glance aside for any explanations. Perhaps
this is the best method for an enthusiast to pursue. He
certainly creates a vivid picture of this strangely unknown
allied people, with its incredible otherworldliness, its broad
tolerant charity, its freedom from chilly conventions, its
joyous neglect of the hustle and fussiness of Western life,
its deep faith, its childish or childlike superstitions, the
glorious promise of its future. An interesting&mdash;even a
fascinating&mdash;rather than a conclusive book.</p>
